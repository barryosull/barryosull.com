# Barry O Sullivan's Blog
Welcome one and all. This is my blog.

It is a simple site that is based on https://github.com/nekudo/shiny_blog, a nice simple Markdown blog.

## TODOs
The list of things I'd like to do in this blog to make it usable

Done:
- Blog listing cuts
- Get vendor folder working with composer
- Make date optional
- Default author to me
- Jekyll parser
  -  Clean up 
- Code syntax should be dark background 
- Google Analytics
  - Disable for development
- Update production instance to use latest PHP7 version
    - Release site
- Blog article cover images
- Publish/Unpublish articles via meta meta info
- Published/Unpublished articles, allows sending links to unpublished articles
- Put files in a public dir
- Publish automatically on commit
- Fix tables in markdown parser, they're not working right (see ES article)
- Fix HTML title on blog


Next:
- Change markdown to accept '\n' 
- Add sharing links (just twitter for now)
- Add my own image hosting (can't use dev.to's, it's just not cool to leech)
- Build pages on deploy, site seems to go slow sometimes
