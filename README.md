# Barry O Sullivan's Blog
Welcome one and all. This is my blog.

It is a simple site that is based on https://github.com/nekudo/shiny_blog, a nice simple Markdown blog.

## TODOs
The list of things I'd like to do in this blog to make it usable

Done:
- Blog listing cuts
- Get vendor folder working with composer
- Make date optional
- Default author to me
- Jekyll parser
  -  Clean up 
- Code syntax should be dark background 
- Google Analytics
  - Disable for development

Next:
- Blog article cover images
- Update production instance to use latest PHP7 version
    - Release site
- Change markdown to accept '\n' 
- Add sharing links (just twitter for now)
- Published/Unpublished articles, set via meta (allows sending links to unpublished articles)
