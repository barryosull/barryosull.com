I am a Lead PHP Developer and Solutions Architect. I work closely with business owners to understand domain problems, architect solutions, then lead the team in their development. 

I have designed and built event sourced applications, using the latest in domain exploratory techniques, such as domain mapping and Event Storming. I have worked remotely for the last 3 years and know how to build and maintain a remote team.

My leading style is centered around best practices, such as automated tests, continuous integration, code reviews, documentation, clean architecture and consistent, maintainable code. I believe that a culture focussed on training and upskilling leads to a better dev team and a better product.

In my spare time I contribute to open source (including the core of PHP), [write articles](/blog) and give talks on software dev, and also run [PHPDublin](https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Dublin/), Ireland's largest PHP meetup group.
