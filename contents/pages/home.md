Hello there. My name is Barry O Sullivan, I am a Lead PHP Developer and Solutions Architect.

I am passionate about writing software that solves real problems. I've been working with startups for 7 years, so I have experience designing and building full solutions from scratch.

### I am actively looking for new opportunities

One my key goals is to make software better over time, not worse. When given a piece of software, if I can make it better I will.

My key skill is writing testable code that expresses the complexity of a business domain. Every developer on the teams needs to work together, so training in design is a key part of what I do.

I also write articles on software developer. Head over to the [Blog](/blog) and have a look.

If you'd like to contact me about opportunities, drop me an email
