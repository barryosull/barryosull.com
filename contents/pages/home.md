# About me
I am a software developer and solutions architect from Ireland, I enjoy writing software and designing solutions to real problems.

My development/leading/training style is centered around best practices, such as automated tests, continuous integration, code reviews, documentation, clean architecture and consistent, maintainable code. I believe that a culture focussed on training and upskilling leads to a better dev team and a better product.

In my spare time I contribute to open source, [write articles](/blog), give [talks](/talks) on software dev, and also run [PHPDublin](https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Dublin/).

If you'd like to contact me about opportunities, drop me <a href="mailto:contact@barryosull.com">an email.</a>
